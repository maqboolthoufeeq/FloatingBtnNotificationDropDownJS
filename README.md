- Notification Center is an “on-page” element that allows us to show specific campaigns or 
discounts to the users.
- In this project, we request you to create a Notification Center as same as the one on the next 
slides.
- Your project has to be shown on every page of LC Waikiki website, except Product Pages.
- Notification Center should have main title.
- Notification Center should only be visible after user visited 3 products. Set notification 
informations according to the last 3 products that user have visited. 
- 3 messages in itself and every single message should have its own title, description, image
and product link.
- Notification Center should be positioned to the right side of the page and should be fixed.
- There should be a “Hide Button” on the right side of the Notification Center as seen on the 
next slides.
